            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p> <i>The Drawing of the Three </i> is the second book in Stephen King's critcally acclaimed <i>Dark Tower</i> series. Set immediately after the end of <i>The Gunslinger,</i> in which Roland is travelling across a barren wasteland in pursuit of the Man in Black and meets a young Jake Chambers (who he kills), we follow Roland on his quest to reach the titular Dark Tower. Roland, who can be described generally as somewhat of a cowboy, is a complex character who develops along this journey we travel along him on. After his encounter with The Man in Black, Roland seeks to fulfill the prophecy he was given and gain new companions. This is where the majority of the book takes place, and where we set up the future of this series. </p>
            <br>
            <p>What follows is a story with heart, drama, found family, and redemption. The doors of "The Prisoner", "The Lady of Shadows", and "The Pusher" all lead to somewhere, and we get to go on this journey with Roland. The prophecy must be fulfilled, the Dark Tower must be reached, and the Man in Black <i>must</i> be stopped.</p>

            <h2>"Childe Roland To the Dark Tower Came"</h2>
            <p>While there are many inspirations for <i>The Dark Tower</i> (including King's own works, present in later books), one somewhat obscure inspiration that you probably haven't heard of it the poem, <i>"Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came."</i> This poem, written by Robert Browning (loosely based on <i>King Lear</i> by Shakespeare) is a 34-stanza long narrative about Childe Roland (Childe meaning untested knight) and his quest in search of this Dark Tower. The quest is at an end, and through travelling this landscape, he remembers the others who tried what he is about to complete. Roland comes to this Tower, blowing his horn, and the poem suddenly ends. </p>
            <br>
            <p>King first read this poem in either 1967 or 1968 while in university. In an interview that was published in his newsletter Castle Rock, King noted that, "The idea of writing this dark fantasy series came froma favorite poem, Robert Browning's 'Child [sic] Roland to the Dark Tower Came'... <br><br> So I started off wondering: What is this tower? What does it mean? And I decided that everybody keeps a Dark Tower in their heart that they want to find."" </p>
            <br>
            <p>Readers and scholars have always been fascinated with this poem, and King is not an exception. That is where he got a primary idea for the Dark Tower. Now, obviously, there are other influences. For one, he was inspired by <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> one of the most iconic fantasy franchises. Along with this, old spaghetti westerns like <i>Gunsmoke</i> were an inspiration for the idea of Gunslingers and the character of Roland. </p>

        <h2>Addiction and Mental Health</h2>
        <p>The two companions Roland picks up, Odetta/Detta (a.k.a. Susannah) and Eddie, have some problems of their own. Susannah, before merging, suffered from Dissociative Identity Disorder and was occupied by the opposing personalities of Odetta and Detta. When we first meet Eddie, he is in the process of smuggling drugs on a plane through the airport. These two flawed characters are what help make this book so great. They bring attention to these issues in a way that keeps readers hooked, but also allows us to understand what this is like and why this is an issue.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eddie, the first ally Roland picks up, is your average drug addict. He's always looking for a fix, constantly getting himself into trouble, and is overall a not-so-great guy. We get to see how his struggle truly is, though, due to Roland effectively possessing Eddie. We see how he got addicted at a rough time, and how he wanted to be like his brother who he saw as an idol. Throughout the book, after Roland draws Eddie, we see how he reacts to not having a fix on hand. He starts aggressive, desperate to go home and to get more to clear his mind. However, through his adventure with Roland and the more time he spends, he slowly gets over it. While he still has somewhat of an addiction, we get to see him recover fully and become the better person he once saw his brother as and wanted to be. It is a wonderful character arc, and one that is representative of a struggle that people go through.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Susannah, on the other hand, is a depiction of mental health disorders and racial tensions. A disabled and wealthy African American woman, Susannash/Odetta/Detta is representative of everything that went <i>against</i> common beliefs at the time. Along with the racism on display throughout Roland's time in her world, we also see from an outsider's perspective the mental health struggles of someone with Dissociative Identity Disorder. Before merging, her mind was occupied by two opposite personalities: Odetta Holmes and Detta Walker. Odetta was the original name that she was born with. As a civil rights activist, she was the daughter of a wealthy and important black man. When she was five, a criminal dropped a brick on her head (this criminal being another major character), causing the personalities to split and form. This same criminal pushed her in front of a train, causing her to lose her legs. Her story is riddled with tragedy, representative of the racial tensions and views at the time. Detta, on the other hand, was a violent, mean, crazy personality fueled by her hatred for white people. The accent her dialogue is written in is a critique of the sterotypical view of how Black people were seen to speak at the time. In the end, her personalities merge in Susannah Dean, who we move forward with.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, through these characters, we get a view and a critique of many issues that Stephen King clearly took up an issue with. We get to explore them as both a central driving force in the plot through Roland's eyes, giving us a nice way to move the book forward while giving us a chance to look back in history and into other people's lives to understand different perspectives, adding more layers to this amazing novel.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>
            In the end, <i>The Drawing of the Three</i> might just be one of the best books I have every read. To give it a rating, I would, without a doubt, have to give it five out of five stars. No book that I have every read has had as unique a premise as this, with a cast of characters as unique, diverse, and most importantly flawed as this cast. Getting to see them bond and grow as people was part of the charm of this novel, and is something I look forward to continuing to see as I read the rest of this series. Getting to see each unique version of New York City from different time periods, to getting to watch all these backstories intertwine, the looming prospect of the Dark Tower, and all the other questions the book leaves open without being unsatisfying. I can only hope that the rest of the series is as good, if not even better than <i>The Drawing of the Three</i>
